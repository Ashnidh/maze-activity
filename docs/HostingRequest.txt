6. Committer list 
   Please list the maintainer (lead developer) as the first entry. Only list 
   developers who need to be given accounts so that they can commit to your
   project's code repository, or push their own. There is no need to list
   non-committer developers.

      Username   Full name             SSH2 key URL                    E-mail
      --------   ---------             ------------                    ------
   #1 jminor     Joshua Minor                                          j@lux.vu

      ...

   If any developers don't have their SSH2 keys on the web, please attach them 
   to the application e-mail.

7. Preferred development model

   [X] Central tree. Every developer can push his changes directly to the 
       project's git tree. This is the standard model that will be familiar to 
       CVS and Subversion users, and that tends to work well for most projects.

   [ ] Maintainer-owned tree. Every developer creates his own git tree, or
       multiple git trees. He periodically asks the maintainer to look at one
       or more of these trees, and merge changes into the maintainer-owned,
       "main" tree. This is the model used by the Linux kernel, and is 
       well-suited to projects wishing to maintain a tighter control on code
       entering the main tree.

   If you choose the maintainer-owned tree model, but wish to set up some
   shared trees where all of your project's committers can commit directly, 
   as might be the case with a "discussion" tree, or a tree for an individual 
   feature, you may send us such a request by e-mail, and we will set up the 
   tree for you.

8. Set up a project mailing list:

   [ ] Yes, named after our project name
   [ ] Yes, named ______________________
   [X] No

   When your project is just getting off the ground, we suggest you eschew
   a separate mailing list and instead keep discussion about your project
   on the main OLPC development list. This will give you more input and 
   potentially attract more developers to your project; when the volume of 
   messages related to your project reaches some critical mass, we can 
   trivially create a separate mailing list for you.

   If you need multiple lists, let us know. We discourage having many 
   mailing lists for smaller projects, as this tends to
   stunt the growth of your project community. You can always add more lists
   later.

9. Commit notifications

   [ ] Notification of commits to the main tree should be e-mailed to the list
       we chose to create above
   [ ] A separate mailing list, <projectname>-git, should be created for commit
       notifications
   [X] No commit notifications, please

10. Shell accounts

   As a general rule, we don't provide shell accounts to developers unless 
   there's a demonstrated need. If you have one, please explain here, and
   list the usernames of the committers above needing shell access.

11. Translation
   [X] Set up the laptop.org Pootle server to allow translation commits to be made
   [ ] Translation arrangements have already been made at _______________

12. Notes/comments:
	This game might fill the role of a Maze Game Template as mentioned
here: http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Game_templates   Also, there is no text in the game
by design, so only the title of the activity would need to be translated.  I have
only tested it under emulation.
